- Interrupting your meditation is considered a grave insult by all Wookiees

**Rewards:** Learn Hibernation and Telepathy. When in natural environments (forests, jungles), you may meditate to ask the "forest spirits" (the Force) one yes/no question per day about events within that environment.

**Special:** If you find and reunite with a lost family member (such as a daughter), the emotional and spiritual reunion grants you +1d6 to Willpower (up to species maximum) as your purpose and hope are renewed.

#### Honored Shaman – "We Carry Their Memory"

**Requirements:** Three clan skills at 80%. Must have reunited separated families or restored a sacred site.

**Duties:** Lead clan ceremonies, advise chieftains, train apprentices, maintain connection between living and ancestral memories.

**Privileges:**

- Access to training in clan skills at 50% discount
- Your life-debt obligations are recognized by all Free Clans
- Personal sacred grove under your care
- May call upon clan warriors (2d6 Wookiee warriors) once per campaign arc
- Free crafting of traditional Wookiee items

**Rewards:** Learn Illusion and Concealment. You also gain the ability to communicate basic ideas and concepts to all natural animals.

#### Elder Shaman – "The Roots Run Deep"

**Requirements:** Two clan skills at 100%, personal wisdom and sacrifice recognized by multiple Free Clans. Must have trained at least one apprentice to Shaman rank.

**Duties:** Unite the Free Clans, preserve the most sacred traditions, make decisions affecting all Kashyyyk survivors, lead the spiritual resistance against the Empire.

**Privileges:**

**Rewards:** Learn Projection and Deny. Once per session, you may enter a deep trance and project your consciousness through the "Tree of Life" (the interconnected Force presence of all Wookiees). While in this state, you can:

- Locate any Wookiee you have personally met, anywhere in the galaxy
- Send brief visions or feelings to other shamans
- Sense great disturbances affecting Wookiee communities

Additionally, the forest itself seems to protect you: when in natural environments, you may spend a luck point to have the terrain itself intervene on your behalf (vines entangle enemies, roots trip pursuers, branches obscure you from sight, etc.).
